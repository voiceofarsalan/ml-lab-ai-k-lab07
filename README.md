# Lab07 – Naive Bayes Classifier (FAST-NUCES)

This notebook demonstrates the application of the **Naive Bayes classification algorithm** using a dataset of SMS messages categorized as spam or ham (non-spam). The objective is to build and evaluate a spam detection model using different variants of Naive Bayes.

## 📂 File

- `21I-0271_ArsalanAhmed_Lab07.ipynb`: The complete implementation of the spam classification system using:
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - Bernoulli Naive Bayes
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes
- The notebook includes detailed preprocessing, training, evaluation, and accuracy comparison of the three models.

## 🛠️ Features

- Tokenization and text vectorization using CountVectorizer.
- Comparison between different Naive Bayes models.
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

## 📊 Output

Accuracies for each Naive Bayes classifier are compared to determine the best performer on spam classification.
